# Professional README Generator

## Project Description

This is a project where we generate a Professional README file using node.js prompt. This README generator will allow the user to answer a series of specific questions and create a professional complete README based on their responses. It will take a couple minutes and provide the developer with the ability to make their project complete and more professional.
